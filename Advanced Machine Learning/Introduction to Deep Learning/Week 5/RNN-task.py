# ### Generating names with recurrent neural networks
# 
# This time you'll find yourself delving into the heart (and other intestines) of recurrent neural networks on a class of toy problems.
# 
# Struggle to find a name for the variable? Let's see how you'll come up with a name for your son/daughter. Surely no human has expertize over what is a good child name, so let us train RNN instead;
# 
# It's dangerous to go alone, take these:

import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
get_ipython().magic('matplotlib inline')


# # Our data
# The dataset contains ~8k earthling names from different cultures, all in latin transcript.
# 
# This notebook has been designed so as to allow you to quickly swap names for something similar: deep learning article titles, IKEA furniture, pokemon names, etc.

# In[2]:

import os
start_token = " "

with open("names") as f:
    names = f.read()[:-1].split('\n')
    names = [start_token+name for name in names]


# In[3]:

print ('n samples = ',len(names))
for x in names[::1000]:
    print (x)
    


# In[4]:

MAX_LENGTH = max(map(len,names))
print("max length =", MAX_LENGTH)

plt.title('Sequence length distribution')
plt.hist(list(map(len,names)),bins=25);


# # Text processing
# 
# First we need next to collect a "vocabulary" of all unique tokens i.e. unique characters. We can then encode inputs as a sequence of character ids.

# In[5]:

#all unique characters go here
tokens = set(",".join(["".join(set(name)) for name in names]))

tokens = list(tokens)

n_tokens = len(tokens)
print ('n_tokens = ',n_tokens)

assert 50 < n_tokens < 60


# ### Cast everything from symbols into identifiers
# 
# Tensorflow string manipulation is a bit tricky, so we'll work around it. 
# We'll feed our recurrent neural network with ids of characters from our dictionary.
# 
# To create such dictionary, let's assign 

# In[6]:

#token_to_id = ###YOUR CODE HERE: create a dictionary of {symbol -> its  index in tokens }

token_to_id = {tokens[i]:i for i in range(len(tokens))}


# In[7]:

assert len(tokens) == len(token_to_id), "dictionaries must have same size"

for i in range(n_tokens):
    assert token_to_id[tokens[i]] == i, "token identifier must be it's position in tokens list"

print("Seems alright!")

# # Recurrent neural network
# 
# We can rewrite recurrent neural network as a consecutive application of dense layer to input $x_t$ and previous rnn state $h_t$. This is exactly what we're gonna do now.
# <img src="./rnn.png" width=480>
# 
# Since we're training a language model, there should also be:
# * An embedding layer that converts character id x_t to a vector.
# * An output layer that predicts probabilities of next phoneme

#

# ### Try it out!
# 
# __Disclaimer:__ This assignment is entirely optional. You won't receive bonus points for it. However, it's a fun thing to do. Please share your results on course forums.
# 
# You've just implemented a recurrent language model that can be tasked with generating any kind of sequence, so there's plenty of data you can try it on:
# 
# * Novels/poems/songs of your favorite author
# * News titles/clickbait titles
# * Source code of Linux or Tensorflow
# * Molecules in [smiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_molecular-input_line-entry_system) format
# * Melody in notes/chords format
# * Ikea catalog titles
# * Pokemon names
# * Cards from Magic, the Gathering / Hearthstone
# 
# If you're willing to give it a try, here's what you wanna look at:
# * Current data format is a sequence of lines, so a novel can be formatted as a list of sentences. Alternatively, you can change data preprocessing altogether.
# * While some datasets are readily available, others can only be scraped from the web. Try `Selenium` or `Scrapy` for that.
# * Make sure MAX_LENGTH is adjusted for longer datasets. There's also a bonus section about dynamic RNNs at the bottom.
# * More complex tasks require larger RNN architecture, try more neurons or several layers. It would also require more training iterations.
# * Long-term dependencies in music, novels or molecules are better handled with LSTM or GRU
# 
# __Good hunting!__

# ### Bonus level: dynamic RNNs
# 
# Apart from keras, there's also a friendly tensorflow API for recurrent neural nets. It's based around the symbolic loop function (aka [scan](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/scan)).
# 
# This interface allows for dynamic sequence length and comes with some pre-implemented architectures.
